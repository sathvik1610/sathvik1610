#  Heylo, I'm Sathvik Pilyanam!

🎓 Computer Science student at **IIT Tirupati** | 💻 Full-stack Developer | ⚙️ CI/CD Explorer | 🌱 Aspiring Software Developer

I'm a curious and hands-on developer who enjoys turning ideas into impactful projects — whether it's optimizing workflows, building clean interfaces, or integrating AI to make tools smarter and more efficient. I love working in collaborative environments, but I'm just as comfortable building things solo, planning carefully, and seeing them through with care.
